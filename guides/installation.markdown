## Requirements
Grind doesn’t need much, just make sure you’re running Node v5+ and NPM v3+.

For information on how to install Node on your OS, head over to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). For macOS, if you already have `brew` installed, just run `brew install node`.

Beyond that, it’s _highly_ recommended you install build tools in order to use npm packages with native extensions.
* For macOS users, install the Xcode command line tools via `/usr/bin/xcode-select --install`
* For Ubuntu/Debian users, install build tools via `apt-get install -y build-essential`

## Installing Grind’s Installer
While not required, `grind-installer` is recommended.  Once installed, it provides the easiest way to get started on a new Grind project.

To install it, run the following npm command:
```shell
npm install -g grind-installer
```
