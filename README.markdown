# grind-docs
This is the main documentation for Grind and what powers [grind.rocks/docs](https://grind.rocks/docs)

Good documentation is key for any framework and contributions are encouraged!  The docs are in markdown, but youâ€™d like to view them locally, you can setup the [Grind site](https://github.com/grindjs/site) project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grindjs/site.git grind-site
cd grind-site/resources
git clone https://github.com/grindjs/docs.git && cd ..
yarn install
bin/cli watch
```

Once running, navigate to [localhost:3900/docs](http://localhost:3900/docs).
